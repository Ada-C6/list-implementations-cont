# Practice Together

Continued from last assignment
+ Let's take a look at `array-list.rb` and `linked-list.rb`. Note that I've included here my solutions
+ Let's talk about how the linked list methods work in `linked-list.rb` by walking through what happens in `test-linked-list.rb`
+ Let's look at the efficiency of the methods we wrote in `linked-list.rb`, particularly `size`

New
+ Look at `lotto.rb` and talk about interfaces vs implementations

# Assignment

+ Let's modify `lotto.rb` so that ticket numbers are displayed in ascending order. Do this by adding `@ticket.sort` to the `display_ticket` method and add this functionality to both `array-list.rb` and `linked-list.rb`
  + Add a method `sort` to `array-list.rb`
  + Add a method `sort` to `linked-list.rb`
+ Write a method `reverse` for both `array-list.rb` and `linked-list.rb`
